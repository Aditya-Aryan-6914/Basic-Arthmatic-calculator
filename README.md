# Python Calculator

## Description
A simple command-line calculator application built with Python that performs basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project demonstrates proper Git workflow, branching strategies, and collaborative development practices using GitHub.

## Features
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Menu-driven interface
- Error handling for invalid inputs

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system

### Installation and Usage
